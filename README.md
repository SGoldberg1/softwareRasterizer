# softwareRasterizer
 Rewrite

This program is a rewrite of 3dgraphicsengine. The original version was written while I was beginning my journey into computer graphics. It lacked many things including: triangle clipping, solving the visibility problem, and triangle interpolation. This project is an attempt to implement a full 3d software rasterizer.
